This repository contains a zip-file with fasta alignments of all 68 intronic regions for which the genetic data was obtained from the fossil Late Pleistocene New World vulture Coragyps occidentalis found in Cueva de San Josecito, Nuevo Le√≥n Zaragoza, Mexico (Miller 1943). The specimen sequenced is a tarsometatarsus stored in the collections of Los Angeles County Museum (LACM 163173). The alignments also include sequences from twelve representativs of the extant Black vulture (Coragyps atratus) and from a Late Pleistocene fossil of Coragyps occidentalis in Peru. In the repository is also a fasta formatted concatenation of all the 68 intronic regions after removing all positions where any of the 14 taxa have missing data.
